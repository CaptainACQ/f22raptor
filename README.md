Initial commit readme...

I've worked on this for 8-10 hours a day since the day
Flight Simulator released.  This is by no means a finished
product, but a work in progress.  I have no team... just one
person here.

The flight model and engine specs are based on my own research
of the Raptor and similar aircraft like the F-16 and older fighters.
I am not a pilot, so I make no guarantees that this aircraft functions
like the real thing.  It is extremely fun to fly though.  High speeds
close to ground level really taxes my machine, but lowering the graphics
settings usually fixes any dropped frames or studdering.

Please don't submit issues yet.  I'm considering this pre-alpha and have
a lot of work to do yet to where I'm happy with it.  At this time, I
decided that it's just too fun to keep it to myself.

Quirks e.g. autopilot at Ma 2.2 at FL650 is hilariously unstable
